## Kotlinverse
Project for simulating the gravitational attractions between celestial bodies. 

### How to use
#### Launching
Launch new planets into the system by pressing the left mouse button and moving the mouse while pressed. Upon releasing the mouse button, a new planet is launched into the system.
While aiming, a preview of the planet appears at the position of the mouse click, as well as a white line showing the direction the planet will be yeeted (or *yote*?).
Pressing the right mouse button while aiming the slingshot cancels the shot.

#### Customizing the planet
Before launching, the mass of the planet can be increased and decrease by pressing the **W** and **S** buttons respectively. Additionally, the color of the planet can be cycled using the **A** and **D** keys. 

### Disclaimer
The simulation is a *very* rough estimation of real world processes, do **not** use for real world applications.
